This project is for me to practice API data analyze skills in Objkt.com, the biggest NFT marketplace for Tezos.
My plan is to focus on big NFT projects such as Dogami(Now), Tezzardz and Ottez.

The File "Accessing GraphQL in R studio" introduced how to access Objkt.com API from R studio
The File "Dogami token attributes" summarized and visualize the distribution of NFT attributes in Dogami collection
