This project is for me to practice API data analysis skills in Objkt.com, the biggest NFT marketplace for Tezos.
I plan to focus on big NFT projects such as Dogami(Now), Tezzardz and Ottez.

The File ".RData" is the data getting from API and sort out after.

The File "Accessing Objkt API(GraphQL) in R studio" introduced how to access Objkt.com API from R studio.
The File "Dogami token attributes" summarized and visualize the distribution of NFT attributes in the Dogami collection.
