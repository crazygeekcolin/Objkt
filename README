This project is for me to practice API data analysis skills in Objkt.com, the biggest NFT marketplace for Tezos.
I plan to focus on big NFT projects such as Dogami(Now), Tezzardz and Ottez.

The File ".RData" is the data getting from API and sort out after.

The File "Accessing Objkt API(GraphQL) in R studio" introduced how to access Objkt.com API from R studio.
The File "Dogami token attributes" summarized and visualize the distribution of NFT attributes in the Dogami collection.

In this project, I conduct these steps in a 205638*6 table:
Analyze the Graphql API, and connect the API to R
Check the data scrapped is completed (due to the API limit, missing data is founded in attempts)

Transform the raw table: the original table combines multiple variables in one column (and table into tables like a JSON), and I separate them into multiple columns.
Transform the data format, such as strings to integers.
To do linear regression in the whole data set and subset, to see the difference of parameters in subsets.
